# Image Smoothing via Unsupervised learning

As a part of the course "Digital Image Processing" (CS 663), we had decided to implement SIGGRAPH Asia 2018 paper "Image Smoothing via Unsupervised Learning" by Qingnan Fan, et al. as our course project. This is the implementation code of the same.

All the code can be found in the notebook named "CS663_FINAL_PROJECT.ipynb". Some of our results have been uploaded in the folder "Results". Enjoy :)
